Only school project.
My website is designed to look like Apple's website and allows customers to learn about and purchase our products.

Design:

We used a similar layout, typography, color scheme, and product imagery as Apple's website.

Functionality:

My website has interactive elements and is not (yet) optimized for mobile devices.

Content:

We provide product information, pricing, contact information.

Usability:

Our website is easy to use and navigate on different devices and browsers, and includes a search function.

Technologies:

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to built this web.
